# Week 2 Exercises

## Description

This folder contains the exercise templates for week 2 of Research Computing with C++. 

You should open this folder in VSCode; this is particularly important if you are using Docker as the top level folder contains the .devcontainer.

You can then move into each sub-folder in the terminal to compile and run the different exercises, as described in the HackMD document.
